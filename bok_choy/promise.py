        Configure the `Promise`.

        The `Promise` will poll `check_func()` until either:
            * The promise is satisfied
            * The promise runs out of tries (checks more than `try_limit` times)
            * The promise runs out of time (takes longer than `timeout` seconds)

        If the try_limit or timeout is reached without success, then the promise is "broken" and
        an exception will be raised.

        Note that if you specify a try_limit but not a timeout, the default timeout is still used.
        This is to prevent an inadvertent infinite loop. If you want to make sure that the
        try_limit expires first (and thus that many attempts will be made), then you should also
        pass in a larger value for timeout.

        `description` is a string that will be included in the exception to make debugging easier.

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            # Dummy check function that indicates the promise is always satisfied
            check_func = lambda: (True, "Hello world!")

            # Check up to 5 times if the operation has completed
            result = Promise(check_func, "Operation has completed", try_limit=5).fulfill()

        Args:
            check_func (callable): A function that accepts no arguments and returns a `(is_satisfied, result)` tuple,
                where `is_satisfied` is a boolean indiating whether the promise was satisfied, and `result`
                is a value to return from the fulfilled `Promise`.

            description (str): Description of the `Promise`, used in log messages.

        Keyword Args:
            try_limit (int or None): Number of attempts to make to satisfy the `Promise`.
                Can be `None` to disable the limit.
            try_interval (float): Number of seconds to wait between attempts.
            timeout (float): Maximum number of seconds to wait for the `Promise` to be satisfied before timing out.
