====================================

UI-level acceptance test framework.

.. warning::
    As of 2022-02-18, `bok-choy is deprecated <https://github.com/openedx/public-engineering/issues/13>`_.
    All tests written using bok-choy have either been removed or are slated to be removed soon,
    and the code for the bok-choy framework itself will be archived in the near future.

    If you are trying to write an acceptance or end-to-end test for Open edX code,
    please use a third-party tool like `Cypress <https://www.cypress.io/>`_ instead.
